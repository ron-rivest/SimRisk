# SimRisk

This repository contains a notebook ``SimRisk.ipynb`` for doing small-scale agent-based
simulations of covid-19 spread.  Documentation is in that notebook.  

The notebook can be exported as tex, then compiled, resulting in SimRisk.pdf.
(The latex title and author list are in the notebook metadata.)
